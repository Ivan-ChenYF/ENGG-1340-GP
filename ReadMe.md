## Project Overview
The Enigma Maze Game is a simple text maze game based on ncurses library where players can create user profiles, explore a randomly generated maze, and try to reach the end. The game features ASCII art, interactive menus, and a variety of gameplay options.

## How to Play
After launching the game, follow the on-screen instructions to create a user and navigate through the maze.
- üó∫Ô∏èClassical mode: Navigate the maze directly in the most classical way
- üå´Ô∏èFog mode: This will be more difficult as your vision is blocked by a crowd fog.

### Game Controls
- **Navigation**: Use Enter for double click and arrow key for navigating the choices.
- **Movement**: Use arrow keys or specific letters (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`) to move through the maze.
- **Pause/Exit**: Use a designated key to pause or exit the game (e.g., `q` to quit).
- **Bomb**: Use a `b` key to pick up the bomb, then use the arrow keys to select the direction of the wall you want to destroy.

## Project Structure
**Library Used**
- Standard library is used with addition of ncurses, ctime and unistd
- Here is an overview of the key files and their functions in the project:

**Source Code**
- `main.cpp`: The main entry point for the game, responsible for initialization and setup. It allows the player to choose the game mode they want.
- `game_state.cpp` and `game_state.h`: Handles the game state, including player position, score, and maze information.
- `random_maze.cpp` and `random_maze.h`: Contains the logic for generating random mazes, relying on DFS algorithms that uses the backtracking principle and providing unqie maze for each play.
- `player_control.cpp` and `player_control.h`: Manages player controls, movement logic and bomb function.
- `print_maze.cpp`: Responsible for printing and displaying maze content. It includes  the visualization of the maze using ncurses, defining boundary and time remains.
- `main_menu.cpp`: Contains logic for the main menu.
- `print_file.cpp`: Handles the printing of files and interface components, including features like displaying ASCII art and accepting user names to engage player
- `user_interface.h`: Defines functions related to the user interface.

**ASCII Art Files**
- `ASCII - Create_User.txt`: ASCII art for the user creation screen.
- `ASCII - Main_Menu.txt`: ASCII art for the main menu.
- `ASCII - Enigma_Maze.txt`: ASCII art for the game title screen.
- `ASCII - Try_Again.txt`: ASCII art for the end-of-game screen(lose).
- `ASCII - Well_Done.txt`: ASCII art for the end-of-game screen(win).
- `ASCII - End.txt`: ASCII art for the end-of-game screen(quit).

**Record**
- `c_e.txt, c_m, c_d.txt` are used for storing records of classical mode
- `f_e.txt, f_m, f_d.txt` are used for storing records of fog mode

**coding requirements**
- ‚úÖ Generation of random game sets or events
   - the maze is generated randomly in each new game using DFS algorithms.  (see **generateMaze()** in [random_maze.cpp](https://github.com/Ivan-ChenYF/ENGG-1340-GP/blob/main/random_maze.cpp))
- ‚úÖ Data structures for storing game status 
   - Dynamic array is used for storing and updating player movement and location inside the maze. (see **player_movement()** in [player_control.cpp](https://github.com/Ivan-ChenYF/ENGG-1340-GP/blob/main/player_control.cpp) [main.cpp] 
- ‚úÖ Dynamic memory management
   - This feature is reflected in the customize mode where player is allowed to input the size of maze they want. (see [main.cpp](https://github.com/Ivan-ChenYF/ENGG-1340-GP/blob/main/main.cpp)
- ‚úÖ File input/output 
   - Players can quit the game in the middle while saving the game status through the game_state function. (see [game_state.cpp](https://github.com/Ivan-ChenYF/ENGG-1340-GP/blob/main/game_state.cpp)
- ‚úÖ Program codes in multiple files 
   - UI design, player control, maze generation and game saving function are coded separately. 
- ‚úÖ Proper indentation and naming styles
- ‚úÖ In-code documentation

## Installation and Setup
To run the game, you'll need a C++ compiler and a terminal or command prompt. Follow these steps to compile and start the game:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open the Terminal in your computer.
   - Download or clone the project to your local machine by using the command line here.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Ivan-ChenYF/ENGG-1340-GP.git
     ```

3. **Compile the Code**
   - Switch to the directory where you clone the game
   - Compile the source code. With Makefile, you can use the following command to create an executable file:
     ```bash
     make compile
     ```

4. **Run the Game**
   - Once the code is compiled, you can run the executable to start the game:
     ```bash
     make run
     ```
